## Syllabus

Please find in the `syllabus` folder of this repository.

## Technical Prerequisites

Please bring your own laptop* and make sure to install the below items **before** attending the first class:

1. Install `R` from https://cran.r-project.org
2. Install `RStudio Desktop` (Open Source License) from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download
3. Register an account at https://github.com
4. Enter the following commands in the R console (bottom left panel of RStudio) and make sure you see a plot in the bottom right panel and no errors in the R console:

```r
install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'gganimate', 'transformr', 'gifski'))
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut)) + geom_bar() +
    transition_states(color, state_length = 0.1)
```

Optional steps I highly suggest to do as well before attending the class if you plan to use `git`:

4. Bookmark, watch or star this repository so that you can easily find it later
5. Install `git` from https://git-scm.com/
6. Verify that in RStudio, you can see the path of the `git` executable binary in the Tools/Global Options menu's "Git/Svn" tab -- if not, then you might have to restart RStudio (if you installed git after starting RStudio) or installed git by not adding that to the PATH on Windows. Either way, browse the "git executable" manually (in some `bin` folder look for thee `git` executable file).
7. Create an RSA key (optionally with a passphrase for increased security -- that you have to enter every time you push and pull to and from GitHub). Copy the public key and add that to you SSH keys on your GitHub profile.
8. Create a new project choosing "version control", then "git" and paste the SSH version of the repo URL copied from GitHub in the pop-up -- now RStudio should be able to download the repo. If it asks you to accept GitHub's fingerprint, say "Yes".
9. If RStudio/git is complaining that you have to set your identity, click on the "Git" tab in the top-right panel, then click on the Gear icon and then "Shell" -- here you can set your username and e-mail address in the command line, so that RStudio/git integration can work. Use the following commands:

    ```sh
    $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    $ git config --global user.email "Your e-mail address"
    ```
    Close this window, commit, push changes, all set.

(*) If you may not be able to use your own laptop, there's a shared RStudio Server set up in AWS for you. Look up the class Slack channel for how to access, or find below the steps how the service was configured:

## Class Schedule

### Week 1

1. Warm-up exercise and security reminder: [1.R](1.R#L1)
2. Intro / recap on R and ggplot2 from previous courses by introducing MDS: [1.R](1.R#L52)
3. Scaling / standardizing variables: [1.R](1.R#L137)
4. Simpson's paradox: [1.R](1.R#L181)
5. Intro to `data.table`: [1.R](1.R#L238)
6. Anscombe's quartett [1.R](1.R#L339)

Suggested reading:

* [Introduction to `data.table`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/articles/datatable-intro.html)
* [`data.table` FAQ](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/articles/datatable-faq.html)
* [Database-like ops benchmark](https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/)
* Hadley Wickham: *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis*. https://ggplot2-book.org/

### Homework 1

0. Load the `nycflights13` package and check what kind of datasets exist in the package, then create a copy of flights dataset into a `data.table` object, called `flight_data`.
1. Which destination had the lowest avg arrival delay from LGA with minimum 100 flight to that destination?
2. Which destination's flights were the most on time (avg arrival delay closest to zero) from LGA with minimum 100 flight to that destination?
3. Who is the manufacturer of the plane, which flights the most to CHS destination?
4. Which airline (carrier) flow the most by distance?
5. Plot the monthly number of flights with 20+ mins arrival delay!
6. Plot the departure delay of flights going to IAH and the related day's wind speed on a scaterplot! Is there any association between the two variables? Try adding a linear model.
7. Plot the airports as per their geolocation on a world map, by mapping the number flights going to that destionation to the size of the symbol!

### Final project

Use any publicly accessible dataset (preferably from the TidyTuesday projects at https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) and do data transformations that seems useful, optionally merge external datasets, generate data visualizations that makes sense and are insightful, plus provide comments on those in plain English.

Submission: prepare an R markdown document that includes plain English text description of the dataset, problems/questions you analyzed, actual R code chunks (printing both the code and its output) doing the analysis, comments and summary/conclusion of the results, and knit the Rmd to HTML, then upload to Moodle before Feb 16, 2022 midnight (CET). Please don't leave the submission for the last minute, and be sure to submit by Feb 9, 2022 if you would like to get some feedback before the final deadline.

Required items:

* use 5 different type of plots (e.g. a scatterplot, boxplot, barchart, map etc.)
* tweak the axis labels (e.g. add axis titles + unit of measurements), provide title and subtitle
* get rid of the gray panel background
* create an animation

The above items with proper homework solutions from the first two weeks will result in "B" grade.

For "A", please also work on the below extra items:

* use `data.table`
* add custom style to your plots by specifying non-default colors, font family, grid etc.
* if the dataset has any spatial aspect, try to create a map (even if some geocoding is required), otherwise try to use some of the stats methods covered in the class (MDS, clustering, PCA)
* publish your results on RPubs.com
